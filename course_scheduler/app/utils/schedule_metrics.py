"""
Schedule metrics and scoring utilities for evaluating schedule quality.

This module provides functions for analyzing schedules and calculating various metrics:
- Day usage analysis (days used, free days)
- Slot analysis (weekly slots, daily slots, gaps)
- Compression metrics (consecutive blocks)
- Schedule scoring based on user preferences

These metrics are used for evaluating and comparing schedules based on
user-defined preferences like day compression and free day requirements.
